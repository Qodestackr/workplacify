# Workplacify Analytics: Turn Desk Booking Data into ROI

Making decisions about your office space can feel like navigating without a map. Are you paying for square footage that sits empty most of the week? Are your teams struggling to find space on busy days? Without the right data, you're just guessing. Effective **desk booking** and **office analytics** are no longer a luxury; they are essential for optimizing costs, improving productivity, and creating a workplace that employees value. Guesswork leads to wasted money and frustrated teams. The right data, however, allows you to make strategic decisions that directly impact your bottom line.

Workplacify is excited to introduce our new Analytics suite, a powerful tool designed to give workplace managers, from SMBs to large enterprises, the clear insights they need. This isn't just about tracking who comes in and when. It's about understanding the rhythm of your office. In this article, we'll show you how the new Base Analytics and People Analytics features work. More importantly, we'll build the business case for how you can use this data to calculate a clear return on investment (ROI) through real estate savings, productivity gains, and improved employee retention.

## What is Workplacify Analytics and Why Does It Matter?

Workplacify Analytics is a new dashboard integrated directly into your desk booking system. It translates raw booking data into simple, actionable insights. For years, companies have struggled with the shift to hybrid work. Key questions often go unanswered: How much space do we _really_ need? Which days are most popular for in-office collaboration? Are our workplace policies actually working?

Our analytics suite is designed to answer these questions directly. It provides a clear view of your workplace utilization, highlighting trends and patterns that are impossible to see in a spreadsheet. This matters because every empty desk represents a cost, and every frustrated employee who can't find a spot represents a risk to productivity and morale. By understanding your office's real-world usage, you can stop making assumptions and start making data-backed decisions that save money and create a more efficient, collaborative environment.

### Introducing Base Analytics: Your Office's Vital Signs

The Base Analytics dashboard is your high-level overview of office health. It provides immediate answers to your most pressing questions about space utilization. Think of it as the command center for your entire workplace portfolio.

As seen in the dashboard, you can instantly view:

- **Overall Desk Utilization:** This is the master metric. It shows you the percentage of available desks that were booked over a specific period. For example, seeing "88.42%" tells you that your space is being used effectively. You can also see the trend, like a "+1.05% from the previous period," to know if your occupancy is growing or shrinking.
- **Peak Day:** This metric instantly identifies the busiest day of the week. Knowing that "Tuesday (100.00% Utilization)" is your peak day helps you manage resources, from catering and cleaning services to ensuring enough collaborative spaces are available.
- **Daily Utilization Graph:** The bar chart provides a simple visual of which days are popular and which are quiet. This helps you communicate to teams when the best days for quiet, focused work might be, versus days ideal for all-hands meetings.

The power of Base Analytics comes from its flexibility. You can filter data for a specific office or view your entire portfolio. You can adjust the date range from the last 7 days to the last 365 days to identify both short-term patterns and long-term trends. This historical **desk booking data** is crucial for forecasting future needs and making informed real estate decisions.

### Introducing People Analytics: Understanding How Your Teams Work

While Base Analytics gives you the "what," People Analytics tells you the "who" and "how." This dashboard shifts the focus from the space to the people using it. Understanding individual and team work patterns is fundamental to building a successful hybrid work culture. An effective hybrid policy isn't one-size-fits-all; it accommodates the diverse needs of your workforce.

The People Analytics table provides a clear, sortable list of user booking behavior, including:

- **Total Bookings:** See your most frequent office-goers at a glance.
- **Avg. Weekly Visits:** This metric helps you understand an employee's typical weekly cadence, which is invaluable for managers looking to coordinate team days.
- **Favorite Day:** This simple data point is surprisingly powerful. If you see that your entire engineering team's favorite day is Thursday, you can ensure they have the project rooms and resources they need on that day. It helps you move from mandating "team days" to facilitating them organically based on existing behavior.

By analyzing this data, you can identify "power users" who can act as workplace champions, or you might spot teams that rarely come in, opening a conversation about what they need from the office. This is how **office analytics** moves beyond simple space management and becomes a tool for improving the overall employee experience.

## The Business Case: Calculating ROI with Office Analytics

Investing in a tool like Workplacify isn't just an operational expense; it's a strategic investment. The data from our new Analytics suite provides a clear path to calculating ROI in three critical areas.

### 1. ROI from Real Estate Savings

Commercial real estate is one of the largest expenses for most companies. In a hybrid model, it's also the area with the most potential for optimization. Workplacify Analytics provides the concrete data you need to "right-size" your portfolio.

#### How to Build the Case:

- **Step 1: Measure True Utilization.** Use the Base Analytics dashboard to track your overall desk utilization across all offices over a 3-6 month period. Let's say your average utilization is 60%, but your peak is only 75%. This means that on any given day, at least 25% of your desks are guaranteed to be empty.
- **Step 2: Identify Inefficient Spaces.** Filter by office or even by floor. You may discover that one of your three floors has a utilization rate of just 30%. This is no longer a guess; it's a fact. According to research from firms like JLL, companies are actively consolidating their real estate portfolios based on this type of data.
- **Step 3: Calculate Potential Savings.** With this data, you can confidently decide to sublease that underused floor or consolidate teams into a smaller footprint. If a floor costs you $50,000 per month, eliminating it translates to $600,000 in annual savings. Your Workplacify subscription cost is a tiny fraction of that, making the ROI massive and immediate.

Without this **office analytics** data, making such a significant real estate decision would be a dangerous gamble. With it, it's a sound financial strategy.

### 2. ROI from Productivity and Collaboration Gains

An effective workplace isn't just about saving money on rent; it's about making employees more effective. The right office environment can foster collaboration and innovation, but a poorly managed one creates friction.

#### How to Build the Case:

- **Eliminate "Booking Friction":** A simple, reliable **desk booking** system saves employees time every week. Instead of wasting 15 minutes searching for a desk or coordinating with teammates on Slack, they can book a spot in seconds. For a 500-person company, saving just 15 minutes per employee per week adds up to thousands of hours of recovered productivity per year. Check out our [Desk Scheduling Efficiency Calculator](https://workplacify.com/free-tools/desk-scheduling-efficiency-calculator) to see for yourself.
- **Facilitate Intentional Collaboration:** Use the People Analytics dashboard to identify departmental trends. If the marketing team prefers Tuesdays and the sales team prefers Wednesdays, you know when to schedule cross-functional meetings. This data-informed scheduling ensures the right people are in the office at the right time. As noted in a Gallup report, hybrid work succeeds when in-office time is purposeful.
- **Optimize Resources for Peak Days:** Knowing your "Peak Day" is Tuesday allows you to allocate resources effectively. You can increase support staff, order the right amount of catering, and ensure meeting rooms are prepared. This prevents the chaos of an overcrowded office and ensures that in-office days are smooth and productive, not stressful.

### 3. ROI from Employee Retention and Experience

The modern employee expects flexibility. A rigid or poorly managed hybrid policy can be a major source of dissatisfaction. Office analytics allows you to build a better employee experience, which is directly linked to retention.

#### How to Build the Case:

- **Data-Driven Policy Making:** Instead of imposing a top-down "three days a week" policy, use the data to understand what's already working. If People Analytics shows that most employees average 2-3 visits per week naturally, you can build your policy around that reality. This approach respects employee autonomy and is far better received than arbitrary mandates. A flexible policy is a key differentiator in today's job market.
- **Ensure a Fair and Accessible Workplace:** Analytics can help you ensure equitable access to office resources. If one team consistently struggles to find space on their preferred day, you can see that in the data and take action, perhaps by assigning them a dedicated "team zone." This prevents frustration and shows that you are actively managing the workplace for everyone's benefit. For more on creating a fair system, see our thoughts on the differences between [desk sharing vs. hot desking](https://workplacify.com/blog/desk-sharing-vs-hot-desking-differences).
- **Reduce "Workplace Anxiety":** The simple act of knowing you have a confirmed desk waiting for you reduces stress. It eliminates the anxiety of commuting to the office only to find there's nowhere to work. This small improvement in daily quality of life contributes significantly to overall job satisfaction, which is a key driver of retention.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**1. What is desk utilization and how does Workplacify calculate it?**
Desk utilization is the percentage of available desks that have been booked over a given period. Workplacify calculates this by dividing the number of unique desk bookings by the total number of available desks, then multiplying by 100. This gives you a clear measure of how efficiently your office space is being used.

**2. How can I use 'People Analytics' to improve team collaboration?**
People Analytics shows you the "Favorite Day" for each employee. By filtering or sorting by team, you can quickly identify the day when most of your team members are already planning to be in the office. You can then officially designate this as a "team day" to maximize in-person collaboration, knowing it aligns with their existing preferences.

**3. Can this data help me decide if I need more or less office space?**
Absolutely. By tracking "Overall Desk Utilization" and your "Peak Day" percentage over several months, you can make a strong business case. If your peak utilization consistently stays below 70%, it's a strong indicator that you can reduce your office space. Conversely, if you're consistently hitting 95-100% on peak days, the data supports an expansion.

**4. How is Workplacify's office analytics different from using manual spreadsheets?**
While spreadsheets can track basic bookings, they are manual, error-prone, and cannot provide instant insights. Workplacify Analytics automates data collection and visualizes it in real-time, showing you trends like peak days and user behavior without any manual work. This saves hundreds of hours and provides far deeper insights than any spreadsheet could. If you're still using one, you might recognize these [signs you've outgrown your office spreadsheet](https://workplacify.com/blog/signs-outgrown-office-spreadsheet).

**5. How does office analytics support our company's hybrid work policy?**
Analytics provides the data to create, validate, and refine your hybrid work policy. You can see if the policy is being adopted, identify which teams are most engaged with the office, and make adjustments based on real-world behavior rather than assumptions. This data-driven approach ensures your policy is effective and well-received by employees.
